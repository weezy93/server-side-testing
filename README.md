### Intro

Today, we'll be going over server-side testing. Up until this point, in order to test our routes, we've been using cURL and Postman. As useful as these tools are, it can become a real pain to be constantly using these to check if our routes are doing what we want them to. Today I will be going over how we can use server side testing to automate that process, and make things much easier to test.

We will be using [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) as our test runner, and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/guide/) as our assertion library.

### Folder Structure

Firstly, let's look at the folder structure. You'll see that in the root of our project, we have a folder called `test`. The way chai works is that it looks for this folder called test, and then runs all the files within it. You can [change the test directory](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10753288/how-to-specify-test-directory-for-mocha) if you want to, and specify a `mocha.opts` file to tell mocha where to look for those tests, but today we'll just be using the default.

### apiTest file requires

In our `apiTest.js` file, let's break down what's going on in the setup section.

```js
var chai = require('chai');
var chaiHttp = require('chai-http');
var server = require('../src/server/app');

var should = chai.should();

chai.use(chaiHttp);
```

The first line requires `chai`, our assertion library. This gives us access to the chai object, and we can change the syntax with which we write our tests. Then we require `chai-http`. This module allows us make http requests from within our test file. Finally, we need a link to our app file. This is where any requests coming from our tests go to, and from there we can hit any of our routes, and see what get's returned.

For today, I will be using the [should](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/#should) style for my tests. Note that you can also use [expect](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/#expect) or [assert](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/#assert). These are simpy different ways of writing the same tests.

Lastly, we tell chai to use `chaiHttp` so that we can make these http requests to our server.

### The first test

Here is the first test:

```js
describe('Get all shows', function() {

    it('should get all shows', function(done) {
        chai.request(server)
        .get('/api/shows')
        .end(function(err, res) {
            res.should.have.status(200);
            res.should.be.json;
            res.body.should.be.a('array');
            res.body.length.should.equal(4);
            res.body[0].should.have.property('name');
            res.body[0].name.should.equal('Suits');
            res.body[0].should.have.property('channel');
            res.body[0].channel.should.equal('USA Network');
            res.body[0].should.have.property('genre');
            res.body[0].genre.should.equal('Drama');
            res.body[0].should.have.property('rating');
            res.body[0].rating.should.equal(3);
            res.body[0].should.have.property('explicit');
            res.body[0].explicit.should.equal(false);
            done();
        });
    });

});
```

We have our first `describe` block, to get all shows. Within that block, we have a single `it` statement. Let's break down the first statement.


```js
it('should get all shows', function(done) {
    chai.request(server)
    .get('/api/shows')
    .end(function(err, res) {

        done();
    });
});
```

By removing all of the test conditions, we can just look at the structure of this request. Within the function, we have a callback, `done`. Because we are making requests to a server, we need some way of telling the function when the requests are finished. So we use a callback once the request has ended, and we have a response.

In order to make a request to our server, we use `chai.request(server)`. Because of this line, we don't need to actually be running our server to run these tests. Mocha will actually do all of this for us. Remember that the variable `server` refers to our `app.js` file. So mocha mocks out our running server, and then sends it the request we specify in the next line. `.get('/api/shows')` means send a get request to the endpoint `/api/shows` I wil be going through the rest of the CRUD actions later on, but you can specify what type of request you want to send through here. (e.g. post/put/delete). Finally, we have our `.end` function with a callback, with 'err' and 'res'. So we now have access to the response objects coming back from our request, and we can test out what these are.

### Our Assertions

```js
describe('Get all shows', function() {

    it('should get all shows', function(done) {
        chai.request(server)
        .get('/api/shows')
        .end(function(err, res) {
            res.should.have.status(200);
            res.should.be.json;
            res.body.should.be.a('array');
            res.body.length.should.equal(4);
            res.body[0].should.have.property('name');
            res.body[0].name.should.equal('Suits');
            res.body[0].should.have.property('channel');
            res.body[0].channel.should.equal('USA Network');
            res.body[0].should.have.property('genre');
            res.body[0].genre.should.equal('Drama');
            res.body[0].should.have.property('rating');
            res.body[0].rating.should.equal(3);
            res.body[0].should.have.property('explicit');
            res.body[0].explicit.should.equal(false);
            done();
        });
    });

});
```

The first thing we generally want to do, is test that the response has a status of 200. After that, these tests will change depending on what you want back from your route. In this case, we are expecting json back. We expect that the response will be an array, as we are 'getting ALL shows', we want that length to equal 4, as there are 4 items in the database. Then after that, we can actually start testing out the values within the array, and making sure that they are equal to what's actually in our database.

### Before and After tests

```js
describe('API routes', function() {

    beforeEach(function(done) {
        knex.migrate.rollback().then(function() {
            knex.migrate.latest()
            .then(function() {
                return knex.seed.run().then(function() {
                    done()
                })
            })
        });
    })

    afterEach(function(done) {
        knex.migrate.rollback().then(function() {
            done();
        });
    });

    describe('Get all shows', function() {

        it('should get all shows', function(done) {
             //Code for tests
        });

    });

});
```

Let's add the above into our code. Mocha has before and after functions that allow us to do something before and after each test. What we want to do with this is clear our database then run a migration and seed before each test, then roll back that migration before we start on the next one. This should give us a clean database with its initial seed each time we start a new describe block.

### Pass the test

So now we have the initial setup with our first test written. So it's time to make it pass. If you run `mocha` in your terminal right now, you should see the following:

```sh
$ mocha
  API routes
    Get all shows
GET /api/shows 200 8.436 ms - 9
      1) should get all shows


  0 passing (50ms)
  1 failing

  1) API routes Get all shows should get all shows:
     Uncaught AssertionError: expected 'testing' to be an array
      at test/apiTest.js:20:36
      at Test.Request.callback (node_modules/superagent/lib/node/index.js:785:12)
      at IncomingMessage.<anonymous> (node_modules/superagent/lib/node/index.js:990:12)
      at endReadableNT (_stream_readable.js:905:12)
```

So now go and edit the route in 'routes/show.js' to make that test pass.

### More mocha routes

So now we have a test for our first GET route which is (hopefully) passing. How can we test our other routes? Let's look at the setup for the other tests we will need. Go through each exercise below and write the tests. Then get them to pass.

1. GET single route - This one should be set up in the same way as the get route above, only the endpoint will be different

1. POST route - Here, we need to send some data with mocha. This is how we would do that:

```js
it('should POST a show', function(done) {
    chai.request(server)
    .post('/api/shows')
    .send({
        name: 'new show',
        channel : 'ABC',
        genre: 'Anything',
        rating: 1,
        explicit: false
    })
    .end(function(err, res) {

        chai.request(server)
        .get('/api/show/' + res.body[0])
        .end(function(error, response) {
        //test code
            done()
        })
    });
});
```

- With a post, we need to send data up to the server. Mocha allows us to do that using `.send` with an object containing our data. Again, we can test what is coming back to make sure we get the correct response from the server. Mocha allows us to nest requests. The reason we would do this is that the POST route with knex simply returns an id in an array. So what we would want to test that this data has actually been saved into our database with another nested request to see if that object has saved correctly.

1. PUT route - This is similiar to the post, we will need to send some data to the server, we will get an id back and then we use that id through our get single route to check the item has been updated correctly

```js
it('should edit a show', function(done) {
    chai.request(server)
    .put('/api/show/1')
    .send({
        name: 'Edited Suits',
        channel : 'New Channel',
        genre: 'Drama',
        rating: 3,
        explicit: false
    })
    .end(function(err, res) {

        chai.request(server)
        .get('/api/show/' + res.body)
        .end(function(error, response) {
            //test code to check object
            done();
        })
    });
});
```

1. DELETE route - This time, we just need to send a delete request to the server, and test what comes back

```js
it('should edit a show', function(done) {
    chai.request(server)
    .delete('/api/show/1')
    .end(function(err, res) {

        done();
    });
});
```

### Conclusion/Next steps

With testing, alot of this becomes repetition. Try going to one of your previous CRUD apps and setting up a test folder to test out your routes.
